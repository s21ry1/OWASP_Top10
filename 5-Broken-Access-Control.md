# OWASP Top 10: 5. Broken Access Control

Broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorization and perform tasks as if they were privileged users. This can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data.

## Example
- URL tampering to access unauthorized resources

## Prevention
- Enforce access control on the server side
- Deny by default
- Log access control failures
