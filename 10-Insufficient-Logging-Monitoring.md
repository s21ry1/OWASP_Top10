# OWASP Top 10: 10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data.

## Example
- No alerting on suspicious activities

## Prevention
- Implement centralized logging
- Monitor and alert on suspicious activities
- Regularly review logs
