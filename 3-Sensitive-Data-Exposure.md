# OWASP Top 10: 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

Sensitive data exposure occurs when applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive information such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes.

## Example
- Unencrypted data in transit or at rest

## Prevention
- Use strong encryption (TLS, AES)
- Do not store sensitive data unnecessarily
- Use secure headers
