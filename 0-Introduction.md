# OWASP Top 10 Introduction

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. The list is compiled by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and is updated regularly to reflect the evolving threat landscape.

## Purpose
The OWASP Top 10 aims to educate developers, designers, architects, managers, and organizations about the consequences of the most common and impactful web application security vulnerabilities. By understanding and addressing these risks, organizations can improve the security of their software and protect users from potential attacks.

## The Top 10 Risks
Each of the OWASP Top 10 risks is described in its own file in this directory, including a summary, example, and prevention tips. The risks are:

1. Injection
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
